Parameters
==========

This section will introduce the various parameters of HAWKS, giving a brief description of what they are and what they do. For some, the technical background is beyond the scope of this documentation and is omitted (for details, please refer to the associated `paper <https://doi.org/10.1145/3321707.3321761>`_).

The parameters can be passed into HAWKS via :func:`~hawks.generator.create_generator` as either a ``dict`` or (the path to) a JSON file. 

.. note::

    Certain future functionality may require the use of a ``dict``, but this will be for limited use cases.

Explanation
-----------

The full set of parameters can be seen in the :ref:`defaults_section`. In the following, each of the config sub-dicts (``"hawks"``, ``"dataset"``, ``"constraints"``, ``"ga"``, and ``"objectives"``) will be explained separately.

The Python type of parameter is also given. For the relevant JSON type, see `this conversion table <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/json.html#encoders-and-decoders>`_.

HAWKS Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Parameters for the ``"hawks"`` sub-dict. Primarily used for :class:`~hawks.generator.BaseGenerator`.

.. tabularcolumns:: JJp{0.5}

.. list-table::
    :widths: 15 10 75
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Name
        - Type
        - Description
    *   - ``"folder_name"``
        - :obj:`str`
        - The name of the directory with which to save everything. This is empty by default to avoid saving in an interactive session.
    *   - ``"mode"``
        - :obj:`str`
        - This is the mode for HAWKS. Currently, only `"single"` is available.
    *   - ``"n_objectives"``
        - :obj:`int`
        - This is the number of objectives to be optimized, which can only be 1 at the moment.
    *   - ``"num_runs"``
        - :obj:`int`
        - The number of runs of HAWKS with different seed numbers.
    *   - ``"seed_num"``
        - :obj:`int`
        - This is the seed number that will be used to generate the seed numbers for each individual run (according to `num_runs`). If one is not provided, it is generated randomly, and saved back into the original config for reproducibility. When `"num_runs"` > 1, the subsequent seeds are based on this initial one.
    *   - ``"comparison"``
        - :obj:`str`
        - Method to extract the best individual from the final population. Using "fitness" selects the individual with the best fitness, whereas "ranking" selects the first individual from the population sorted by stochastic ranking.
    *   - ``"save_best_data"``
        - :obj:`bool`
        - Save the dataset from the best (most fit) individual across for each run for each config.
    *   - ``"save_stats"``
        - :obj:`bool`
        - Save the output values (fitness, penalities etc.) for every individual.
    *   - ``"save_config"``
        - :obj:`bool`
        - Flag to save the (full) config associated with the run.

        - :obj:`str`
        - The name of an argument to the objective. The value of this will vary by objective, and the value depends on this argument. See either :ref:`defaults_section` for an example, or in the relevant :mod:`hawks.objectives` documentation.

        - :obj:`int`
        - The size of the dataset i.e. number of datapoints/examples. Warning: High values of this can slow down HAWKS, as the silhouette width does not scale well (despite some computational tricks used here).

.. _defaults_section:

Defaults
--------
The defaults values below are pulled from the ``defaults.json``. For any variables that are not specified, these are used instead.

.. literalinclude:: ../../hawks/defaults.json
    :language: json
    :caption: Default parameters

Multi-config
------------

Multiple runs of HAWKS with varying parameters can be specified by a single config, by wrapping the parameters as a list e.g. ``"num_examples": [500, 1000, 1500]`` will run HAWKS three times with three different values for the number of examples. This works combinatorially, so a warning is raised when more than 1,000 runs are expected.

This makes experimenting easier, which is covered in :ref:`experiments_page`. An example of this is given :ref:`here <example_multiconfig>`.
